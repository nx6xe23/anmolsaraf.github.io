I am a Software Developer at Amazon, India, and on the Aurora Storage team. I studied Electrical Engineering at IIT Bombay, where I worked closely with [Prof. Anupama Kowli](https://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/web/people/anupama-kowli/) on my B.Tech project on “Predictive Analysis for Smart Connected Buildings”.

I am also part of a research cohort under [Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi](https://vijay.faculty.bio/) at Harvard University, where I am working on a framework for systematically benchmarking LLM-based RTL generation.

My research interests are in Edge computing, Distributed systems and Data-centric systems. I am interested in creating systems that are efficient, reliable and scalable. I am also interested in the intersection of systems and machine learning and how we can leverage machine learning to build better systems.

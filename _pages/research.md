This work is done under the guidance of Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi. The goal of this project is to develop a framework for benchmarking LLMs in their ability to generate RTL design. This tool is a part of the larger project of developing foundational models for hardware design. Since there is less work done in the field of benchmarking LLMs for RTL generation, this project aims to fill that gap. The tool is designed to test the LLMs on their ability to generate RTL code for a given design. The tool is modular in design, with the ability to test different LLMs on different designs. The tool is designed to be user-friendly, with the user only needing to provide the design specification and the LLM to be tested.
<br><br>
The tool systematically prompts the LLM using five different prompt techniques, namely, zero shot, few shot, chain of thought, raw context, and summarized context mode. The tool then handles the generated RTL and checks syntax, and correctness through simulation tests at module as well as complete design level. There are 3 different difficulty levels the LLM can be tested on, namely, easy (1 code line insertion), medium (4-6 code line insertion), and hard (full module generation). Furthermore, we are planning on integrating it with SiliconCompiler, to test if the design is synthesizable.

This project was conducted under the guidance of Prof. Anupama Kowli and aimed to investigate and develop solutions for challenges related to smart meters in connected buildings. The primary issues addressed were data loss due to network instability and security concerns arising from the high volume of data generated by smart meters, which ranges in granularity from seconds to minutes.
<br><br>
To address security concerns, we trained machine learning models to predict household appliances based on electricity consumption patterns. Using 15-minute, daily, and monthly consumption data from 116 households across India, we applied random forest, XGBoost, and multi-layer perceptron models. Results indicated a strong correlation between consumption patterns and household appliances, achieving prediction accuracy between 70% and 80%. While higher data granularity did not significantly boost accuracy, incorporating daily temperature data did lead to improvements.
<br><br>
To address data loss, we experimented with various statistical and machine learning-based imputation techniques, achieving a best model performance of 6% MAPE. The most effective approach combined statistical and machine learning methods, outperforming alternatives such as GANs, autoencoders, and random forest. Our imputation strategy used standard interpolation for single missing data points, while a combination of historical averaging and linear interpolation was applied for gaps under a day. For missing data spanning more than a day, KNN emerged as the most effective technique.
<br><br>
To further address privacy concerns, we developed models to predict half-hourly load profiles for both individual and clustered households using only monthly consumption and time-of-use tariff data. For clustered households, the model achieved a 7% NMAE using monthly consumption data. This approach allows us to substitute individual half-hourly data with aggregated monthly data for clusters of households, with minimal loss in accuracy. By using less granular, aggregated data, we effectively reduce privacy risks associated with fine-grained household consumption records.

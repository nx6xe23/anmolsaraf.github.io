This work is done under the guidance of Prof. Vijay Janapa Reddi. The goal of this project is to develop a framework for benchmarking LLMs in their ability to generate RTL design. This tool is a part of the larger project of developing foundational models for hardware design. The tool is modular in design, any LLM can be evaluated for any RTL design and the results can be compared. 

The tool systematically prompts the LLM using five different prompt techniques, namely, zero shot, few shot, chain of thought, raw context, and summarized context mode. The tool then handles the generated RTL and checks syntax, and correctness through simulation tests at module as well as complete design level. 
<br><br>
There are 3 different difficulty levels the LLM can be tested on, namely, easy (1 code line insertion), medium (4-6 code line insertion), and hard (full module generation). Furthermore, we are planning on integrating it with SiliconCompiler, to test if the design is synthesizable.
